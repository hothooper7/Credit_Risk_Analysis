# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, as well as various algorithms, the following will show which models best predict credit risk and whether or not they should be used for making loan decisions.  

## Results of recall scores of six machine learning models

Naive Random Oversampling

As demonstrated by the images above: 
1.  The balanced accuracy score is .65 or 65% accurate.
2.  The precision for high risk loans is .01 or 1% accurate vs. low risk precision of 1.0 or ~100% accurate.
3.  The sensitivity for high risk loans is .63 vs. low risk loan sensitivity of .67.
